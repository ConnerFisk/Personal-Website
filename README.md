# My Personal Website
###### About
Currently working on a personal website to showcase projects and display my work & education experience.

###### Design Style
At around 5th grade, I had saved up enough money to buy my first laptop. On that laptop, I had a low poly planet design picture as my desktop background. 
This style has always stood out to me, and when brainstorming ideas to deign my website around, this was one of the first that hit my mind.
